For lightTPD users, please use the following rules:
url.rewrite-if-not-file += ( "^/(.*)$" => "/index.php/$1" )
(Provided by kk198)

If your TWIP installation have a prefix of /twip/, then you should use

^/twip/(.*)$

instead of 

^/(.*)$.

Just a reminder, please specify the index-file to "index.php"

lighTPD:

index-file.names   = ( "index.php", "index.html",
                       "index.htm", "default.htm" )

nginx:

location / { # it can be /twip as well
  index-file index.php;
}
